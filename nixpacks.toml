# Nixpacks configuration for Railway
# See: https://nixpacks.com/docs/configuration/file

# System packages needed for OCR (scanned PDF chord charts)
# These are additional packages - nixpacks will still auto-detect Python

[phases.build]
# Only run collectstatic during build - it doesn't need DATABASE_URL
cmds = ["python manage.py collectstatic --noinput"]

# Start command is defined in railway.toml
# Migrations run at runtime when DATABASE_URL is available
